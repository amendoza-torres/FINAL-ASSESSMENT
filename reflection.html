      <p> The concept of Responsive design is to design to the user's behavior and
        environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. Responsive design is to 
        think about what is the best way to design a website that will be viewed on hundreds
        of different screen sizes. This means that responsive design is an approach to creating a 
        web page using flexible layouts, flexible images and cascading style sheet media queries.
        Building a website with responsive design will detect the user's screen size and orientation and
        change the layout accordingly. Researching about responsive design I learned that when we make/design 
        a website using responsive design, this will make the website avaible for everyone anywhere. I also 
        learned that when designing a website it is best to always start designing for mobile phones and then
        after we can focus on devices with bigger screen, this will make things easier. 
        <br>
        A huge advantage of using 
        responsive design is that web designers, user interface designers and us web developers don't have to create a
        custom Web design for each group of users.
        <br>
        <br>
        The techniques I used in my responsive design we're media queries and transition. To be able to make my web page
        mobile responsive I used two technologies, HTML and CSS. In my HTML file I used the meta tag and in CSS @media querie.
        <br>
        <br>
        While building web apps for different devices I learned that since we live in a multi-screen society 
        doing so is very important, it will make the website mobile friendly and improve the way it looks on 
        devices with any screen size. I have a 13 inch laptop and when studying on my laptop I always open up
        two screens side by side. It was much easier to work on this assesment with on screen having my website and next to it
        my visual code, for other assignemnts I always had to scroll side to side to view my whole website. Responsive Design is
        a a great design and I will for sure always include responsive design in my future projects!
